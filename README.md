# r9-git-tools
Useful scripts and git extensions for working with the R9 repository. Most notable feature is the wiki wool, which automatically opens the wiki entry creation page and populates it based on the content of the last commits.

### Dependencies
This package is based with the standard R9 toolset in mind (macbook pro, relmail, etc.) and may not work in other environments. The wiki/JIRA manipulation used here only works with Chrome.

Also depends on chrome-cli, which is available in brew.
